I will send you text in hOcr format, look for a table, read text, find what was bought in the table, amount and a price for one position and total amount.
Use  cyrillic Ukrainian language as a default language.
 Please fill in the data parameters in JSON format:

[
{
"name": "String",
"price": "String",
"totalPrice": "String",
"quantity": "String"
},
{
"name": "String",
"price": "String",
"totalPrice": "String",
"quantity": "String"
}
]

If you cannot find the corresponding information for a particular specification, you can set it to null.
As a response I need only JSON and nothing else.
